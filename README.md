# AI-Driven PET Production Forecaster and Calculator

Welcome to the AI-Driven PET Production Forecaster and Calculator repository! This project aims to help manufacturers in the plastic industry optimize their plastic (PET) usage and predict future production demands. By leveraging Machine Learning (ML) for forecasting and a PET consumption calculator, users can estimate monthly production requirements, the total PET needed (in grams), and the associated cost (based on a per-gram rate).

## Overview

In the plastic manufacturing industry, itâ€™s crucial to accurately forecast production volumes to minimize costs and ensure a steady supply of raw materials. This repository showcases:-
- A Machine Learning model (Linear Regression or Neural Network) to predict monthly production numbers based on historical data.
- A PET Calculator that computes how many grams of PET are required for a single product (e.g., a plastic cup), given its dimensions and thickness.
- A Cost Estimator that multiplies the predicted production requirement by the PET needed per product and a user-defined cost per gram.
The result is a holistic solution to forecast production demand and calculate material requirements in a single step.

## Features

 


- **Production Forecasting**
Uses historical data (months and production volumes) to train a model for predicting future production demand.
Demonstrates both scikit-learn (Linear Regression) and TensorFlow (Neural Network) approaches.

- **PET Usage Calculation**
Translates product dimensions (outer radius, inner radius, height, and optional handle dimensions) into an estimated PET weight in grams.
Allows customization of thickness, density, and shape (via geometry formulas).

- **Cost Estimation**
Allows users to set a cost per gram (e.g., 20 rupees/gram).
Quickly derives total monthly cost based on forecasted production.

- **Easy Integration**
Written in Python, a widely used language for AI, data science, and scripting.
Flexible structure that can be adapted to real-world or synthetic data.

- **Visualization**
Generates plots using Matplotlib to visualize both historical production data and model predictions


## Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+

## Workflow Description

- **Data Ingestion**Historical production data is read from a CSV or generated synthetically.
- **Feature Engineering & Model Training**Input features (months) are fed into a scikit-learn or TensorFlow model.
Model learns the relationship between month and production.
- **Prediction**Model predicts production for the next month (or multiple months ahead).
